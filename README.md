# Movie Trailer Website Project
This is a project for Udacity's [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)

## Project Description:
This is a project that produces an HTML website from python to create a website 
that displays several movies. (Some of my all time favorites!)
Clicking on the movie poster will play that movie's trailer.

## This Project Requires:
It seems everyone needs something and this project is no exception! If you want
to run this program you will need Python 2.x (built using 2.7). If you have 
that installed, you should be good to go.

## Project Contents:
* Media.py --> File where I create my Movie class.
* entertainment_center.py --> Main python script to run program. This is the file 
that will need to be run. 
* fresh_tomatoes.py --> originally supplied by Udacity, this file actually creates 
the HTML file.

## Run The Project Already!
1. Download or clone this project to your desktop or chosen location.
1. Open Terminal (Linux/Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
1. Navigate to where you downloaded this project
1. Run ```python entertainment_center.py```

At this point, your default browser should launch a new tab that is showing the 
movie trailer website. Now you can see all the weird movies I love.

## Additional Features/Changes Added:
* Added the storyline of the movie to the website.
* Added the release date to the Movie class, which is also displayed on the website.
* Added subtle drop shadow to the movie poster images.
